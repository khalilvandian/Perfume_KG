# technical challenge

We might meet following techical challenges:

- Issues with crawlers on the website.
- Issues with entity linking problems.
- Deduplicate and data lacking.

Here's the detailed explannation:

The first possible technical challenge we will meet is the powerful anti-crawler when crawling the data from sells website. Some Website may have login requirement, we have to save cookies or use some tricks to get the comments, rating, and some other detailed info.

Then the entity linking challenge. Some products may have very different titles and they are not likely to linked with each other through title although they are the same entities, while others may have similiar titles but not likely to be same entities.

Deduplicate and data lacking. Some entities may lack of data while others may appear duplicate on several platforms.
